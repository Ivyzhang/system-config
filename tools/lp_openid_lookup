# Simple wrapper for the OpenId reverse lookup method in the LP API,
# useful when you need to determine the LP account associated with a
# login.launchpad.net OpenId. Pass the OpenId URL in question as the
# only command-line parameter, and run this in the gerrit2 homedir on
# review.openstack.org (or hack it to use your own LP API key instead).
